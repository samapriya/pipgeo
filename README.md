# pipgeo: CLI for Unofficial windows Geospatial library wheels

The amazing work of [Christoph Gohlke](https://www.cgohlke.com/) is the source of all this, though the unofficial windows binaries page at lfd is no longer maintained. Christoph has created a [dedicated GitHub repository with a subset of geospatial wheel assets that have been released]((https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial.whl)). This tool is a straightforward CLI that can pre-install a binary wheel from the latest release assets.
