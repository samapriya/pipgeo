# pipgeo: CLI for Unofficial windows Geospatial library wheels

[![CI pipgeo](https://github.com/samapriya/pipgeo/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/samapriya/pipgeo/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

The amazing work of [Christoph Gohlke](https://www.cgohlke.com/) is the source of all this, though the unofficial windows binaries page at lfd is no longer maintained. Christoph has created a [dedicated GitHub repository with a subset of geospatial wheel assets that have been released](https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial.whl). This tool is a straightforward CLI that can pre-install a binary wheel from the latest release assets.
